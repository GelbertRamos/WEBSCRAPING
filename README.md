Added Numerical Values: I included numerical values on top of each bar in the plot. These values represent the university rankings, providing a clear visual representation of the ranking distribution.

Adjusted Bar Plot Formatting: The bar plot was updated to ensure better readability. This includes setting the figure size, rotating x-axis labels for better visibility, and adjusting the text position for ranking values.

Printed University Information: I added a print statement to display the university information DataFrame, including the cleaned and converted ranking values.

Additional Data Analysis: The code performs basic data analysis, calculating and printing statistics such as average, median, minimum, and maximum university rankings.

Saved Data to CSV: The DataFrame with university information is saved to a CSV file named 'university_data.csv' for future reference.

Overall, these modifications aim to provide a more informative and visually appealing representation of university rankings in the United Kingdom.
